# What It Does

This is just a simple BMI calculator built with Flutter.

**You can preview the app [here](https://coletoncodes-flutter-quiz-app.web.app/).**

 This will open up a browser version of the application.

# What I Learned

This project allowed me to find a design on Dribbble and build a UI similar to it. Thankfully, with Flutter it's easy to build custom widgets and UIs.

**Some other skills I learned/used with this project:**
- How to use Flutter themes to create coherent branding.
- How to create multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- How to extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button.
- How to pass functions as parameters and fields.
- How to use the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- How to use custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- How to customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
- Understand Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Learn about composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
- Understand the difference between const and final in Dart and when to use each.


### Features & Ideas For The Future

I would like to keep working on this idea and provide accurate calculations for both men and women. (Currently, you get the same result regardless of what you choose.)
